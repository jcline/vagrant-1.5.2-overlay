This is a portage overlay adding packages for vagrant 1.5.2.

The shortlist of changes:
 - Add ruby20 support
   - Upgrade chef to 10.28.0
   - Add ruby20 to a bunch of existing and new ebuilds
 - Add a bunch of new packages that aren't curently in the tree

TODO:
 - Fix vagrant plugin installation. For some reason it won't install
   things when vagrant is installed this way.
 - More testing

License:

All of the ebuilds here are pulled from the portage tree, then modified.
Whatever license those have is what they will have here. It's unclear to
me what that license is, however.
